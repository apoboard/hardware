The system is based on an Atmega328p microcontroller (the same device in the Arduino Uno) and can be programmed with an FTDI serial adapter and the Arduino IDE. There is a DC/DC boost-converter to provide 5 volts from a single AA battery to a microphone, amplifier, and 3 RGB LEDs that are driven from common PWM channels. There is also a momentary tactile button for user input.

</p>

This board uses an Atmega328p microcontroller (the same device in the Arduino Uno) and can be programmed with an FTDI serial adapter and the Arduino IDE. There is a DC/DC boost-converter (the PAM2401) to provide 5 volts from a single AA battery. On board are 10 addressable WS2812 LEDs (the same LEDs used on all Neopixel products). There is also an infrared (IR) transmitter/receiver pair that allows the boards to communicate with one another. A tactile button is also provided to switch through modes.
